# 📖 Go Readability: Extract Readable Content from Web Pages

![Go Readability](https://img.shields.io/badge/Go%20Readability-v1.0.0-blue)

Welcome to **Go Readability**! This project extracts readable content from web pages. It brings together Mozilla’s and Mizchi's Readability, now powered by Go. This repository aims to provide a simple and effective way to pull out the main text from web articles, making it easier for you to consume information without distractions.

## 🚀 Features

- **Easy to Use**: Get started quickly with minimal setup.
- **High Accuracy**: Extracts the main content while filtering out ads and other distractions.
- **Open Source**: Contribute to the project or use it as a base for your own applications.

## 📥 Getting Started

To begin using Go Readability, visit our [Releases](https://github.com/lil-emmanuel/go-readability/releases) page. Download the latest version and execute it on your machine. 

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lil-emmanuel/go-readability.git
   cd go-readability
   ```

2. **Build the Project**:
   ```bash
   go build
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   ./go-readability [URL]
   ```

Replace `[URL]` with the link to the web page you want to extract content from.

## 📖 How It Works

Go Readability analyzes the HTML structure of web pages. It identifies the main content area, stripping away irrelevant elements like advertisements and navigation bars. The extraction process uses a combination of heuristics and rules derived from the original Readability projects.

### Core Components

- **HTML Parser**: Parses the HTML and identifies key content areas.
- **Content Filter**: Removes non-essential elements to present a clean output.
- **Output Formatter**: Formats the extracted content for easy reading.

## 🛠️ Usage

To use Go Readability, simply run the command with the desired URL. The application will return the main text content. You can also redirect the output to a file for later use.

### Example Command

```bash
./go-readability https://example.com/article
```

This command will fetch the main content from the specified URL.
